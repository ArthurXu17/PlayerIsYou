### About PlayerIsYou

PlayerIsYou is a puzzle game that is inspired by an indie game "Baba is You." It is a unique RPG where the character is able to move text boxes to alter the rules of the game.

### Some Examples

A very common tactic is to move the "win" textbox to alter the win condition of the level.

Another very common function is to move the "push" textbox to alter what tiles are able to be pushed. You can also move the "you" tile to alter which tiles you can control (sometimes you will control multiple objects at once!)

All in all, there are many more tiles that we can alter to create and solve increasingly difficult puzzles such as the following:
